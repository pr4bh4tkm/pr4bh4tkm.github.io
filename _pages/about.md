In 2025, I am researching the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) technology in China as a Visiting Fellow at the Harvard Yenching Institute. My current research provides a rigorous interdisciplinary analysis of the governance dynamics surrounding AI in China, integrating insights from economics, geopolitics, political science, and technology studies. I spent a year as a Senior Visiting Scholar at Tsinghua University, Beijing where I conducted extensive fieldwork and interviews with AI experts, entrepreneurs, and academics. I studied Chinese language at the National Taiwan Normal University, Taipei.
